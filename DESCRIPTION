Description: Biodiversity indicators are estimated from biodiversity monitoring 
programs. These indicators are used to make conservation and management decisions. 
In mose ecological applications, models fitted to the biodiversity data are fitted using 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, and these models can be computationally expensive.
This package provides functions to update these biodiversity indicators with a relatively
shorter period. The algorithm assumes that a model has already been fitted using MCMC, 
and the posterior distribution of latent states and model parameters are updated using
importance sampling.
